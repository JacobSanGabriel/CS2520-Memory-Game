# CS2520-Memory-Game
Simon says-style memory game where users have to input the correct sequence to progress, difficulty increases as you select the correct sequence.
You can start the game by clicking start and once you do, the colors on the screen will blink white.
The white blinks indicate the sequence, so if you select the correct color, another color will turn white.
Click the colors in the order of the white blinks to continue the game.
Once an incorrect color is selected, the game will tell you it's over and you can start again by clicking start.
